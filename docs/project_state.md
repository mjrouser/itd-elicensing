##ITD-eLicensing 

###Portal Purpose & Version Timeline
Intended to be the front page and entry point for all commonwealth licensing and permitting.  

V. 1.0 utilizes the commonwealth's Google search appliance to provide a search functionality and simple links to pages for further information and applications can be found.

V. 2.0 will utilize a business logic wizard provided by a vendor that walks potential applicants through a series of questions, and informs said applicants of the licenses/permits they need to appy for.

V. 3.0 connects the wizard interface to the Accela back-end so that they are able to begin their application imediately and on-line.
